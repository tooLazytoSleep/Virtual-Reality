CFD Data visualization and HTC vive VR
The Virtual Reality (VR) technology has developed for many years, and it has been applied in many areas because of its advantages.  

First, industrial products or services can be presented with VR technology more directly. The equipment maintenance, fault diagnosis, and maintenance tutorials can be delivered to customers to ensure the normal operation of equipment.  Second, VR can give an advanced simulation.  In many cases, the internal structures are not able to be captured, and the text a are not vivid enough and specific enough for the customer.  Explain productsâ€™ features and advantages through VR allows costumers to quickly understand the product.

Although the VR technology has been applied in many fields, the abstract data has never been combined with VR.  Combining the data and VR technology is a good method of demonstration for some specific industries such as steel company, because the data is very important to the customers.

The development of a Virtual Reality (VR) Data Visualization program will be created with a computer and a HTC Vive.  The new system will allow users to have more intuitive sense of the product or services, gain an advanced simulation and protect workers from hazardous situation.
